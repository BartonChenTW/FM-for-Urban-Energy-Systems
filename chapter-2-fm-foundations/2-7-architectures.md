# 2.7 Architectures: Transformers, Graph Neural Networks, Neural Operators
{: .no_toc }

ML-basics content for readers arriving from the energy-systems side. Covers what each architecture family actually does, aimed at the level needed to follow [Chapter 4](../chapter-4-directions/index.html) and [Chapter 5](../chapter-5-case-study/index.html) — not a complete technical treatment.

Architecture (D3 in [§2.2](2-2-five-design-decisions.html)) is determined largely by what structure the data has. This section covers the three families used throughout this book.

## Transformers and attention

A transformer processes a set of tokens (see [§2.2](2-2-five-design-decisions.html) for what a token is in this domain) using a mechanism called **attention**: for every token, the model computes how much it should "attend to" every other token when forming its own updated representation, dispensing with recurrence and convolution entirely.[^vaswani2017attention] Concretely, this lets a heat pump's token be updated in light of the electricity bus it draws from and the heat bus it feeds, without the architecture needing to be told in advance which tokens are related — the model learns the relevant relationships from data.

This is why transformers dominate sequence and largely-unstructured data: attention is a general-purpose way to let any element influence any other, at the cost of computing a relationship for every pair of tokens (**quadratic cost** in the number of tokens), which is the practical limit on how many tokens a transformer can process at once. Patching — grouping several raw values into one token, as time-series FMs do (see [§2.4.1](2-4-1-time-series-fms.html)) — is the standard way to buy longer effective context within this budget.

**Cross-attention**, used repeatedly in this book (e.g. [§2.3.3](2-3-choosing-a-basic-element.html#233-representation-strategies-and-testable-predictions), R2), is the same mechanism applied between two different sets of tokens: one set (say, building attributes) modulates how another set (a demand profile) is interpreted, rather than simply being appended to it as extra input columns.

## Graph neural networks (GNNs)

Where a transformer's attention considers all pairs of tokens by default, a **graph neural network** works on data that already has an explicit relational structure — a graph of nodes and edges — and restricts computation to follow that structure. The standard mechanism is **message passing**: each node updates its representation by aggregating information from its immediate neighbours, and stacking several such layers lets information propagate further across the graph.

This is the natural architecture whenever the data genuinely is a network — bus/line topology in power systems, or hub/pipe topology in district heating (see [§4.9.2](../chapter-4-directions/4-9-2-methods-tier2.html) for this book's treatment of GNNs at district scale). A **heterogeneous** GNN extends this to graphs with multiple distinct node and edge types (a heat pipe is not the same edge type as a power line), which is the relevant case for multi-carrier systems.

GNNs and transformers are not mutually exclusive: a common and effective pattern is local message passing for physically-local interactions, combined with a global attention layer for system-wide correlations that a purely local mechanism would take many layers to propagate (see [§4.9.2](../chapter-4-directions/4-9-2-methods-tier2.html)).

## Neural operators

Both transformers and GNNs learn mappings between finite-dimensional vectors (or sets of vectors). A **neural operator** instead learns a mapping between *functions* — for example, a mapping from a boundary-condition function to the resulting temperature field, rather than from a fixed set of sample points to another fixed set of sample points. This matters when the underlying physics is genuinely continuous (a temperature field along a pipe, a pressure field in a network), because the model can then be evaluated at any spatial resolution, not only the one it was trained on.

Two concrete families: the **Fourier Neural Operator** learns mappings between function spaces using spectral (Fourier-domain) parameterisations, targeting families of parametric partial differential equations rather than one fixed instance;[^li2020fno] **DeepONet** learns solution operators directly, splitting the network into a branch that encodes the input function and a trunk that encodes the query location, based on a universal approximation theorem for operators.[^lu2021deeponet] See [§4.9.2](../chapter-4-directions/4-9-2-methods-tier2.html) for when to choose a neural operator over a GNN in this domain.

## The common thread

All three families are ways of building in an **inductive bias** — an assumption about the data's structure baked into the architecture rather than left for the model to discover from scratch. Sequence position for transformers, graph adjacency for GNNs, function-space continuity for neural operators. Choosing badly does not make learning impossible, but it makes it need far more data to discover a structure the architecture could have been given for free — which is exactly why D1–D3 in [§2.2](2-2-five-design-decisions.html) are treated as the central design decisions in this book, not implementation detail to be settled last.
