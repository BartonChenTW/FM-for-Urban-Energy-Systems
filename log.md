## 2026-09-11

- Added private planning files, excluded from the site: `TODO.md` (task list), `outline.md` (proposed new textbook structure, for review), `log.md` (this file).
- `_config.yml`: added an `exclude:` list (`TODO.md`, `outline.md`, `log.md`, `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`, `vendor/`).
- Added `add/FM_for_UES.md` and `add/reference.md`: working notes and references from an earlier conversation, to be merged into the textbook.
- Recorded the repo aim in `TODO.md`: a living knowledge base for UES people to learn about FMs; long-term goal to build an FM for UES.
- Added `LICENSE` (CC BY 4.0 for the written content).
- `_config.yml`: enabled `jekyll-redirect-from` (ready for use once the outline restructure renames pages); excluded `add/` from the build so the working notes and personal-communication references aren't reachable on the published site before merging.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (error report, reference suggestion, section proposal) to support outside contributions.
- Added `references/fm-for-ues.bib`: starter BibTeX bibliography (~16 entries) for Zotero import, seeded from confirmed-metadata entries in `add/reference.md` §1–4 and `11-references.md`. Citation keys follow `firstauthorYEARshortname`, matching the planned footnote-citation convention. Added `references/README.md` explaining import and how to contribute entries; excluded the `.bib` itself from the site build but kept the README as a page.
- Claude's setup suggestions from the prior session (LICENSE, redirects, CONTRIBUTING, `add/` exclusion, references folder) are now implemented; marked done in `TODO.md`. Still open: references workflow decision (hand-written footnotes vs. `jekyll-scholar` via GitHub Actions), and the outline restructure itself (blocked on Barton's review of `outline.md`).
- Added `_includes/page-status.html`: renders a "Status / Last reviewed" badge from page front matter. Added `status: draft` + `last_reviewed: 2026-09-10` (the v1.1 publish date) and the include call to all 14 chapter/appendix pages (skipped `index.md`, which already has a version/date label).
- Added `.github/workflows/link-check.yml` (lychee, on push/PR to main + weekly) and `.github/lychee.toml`. Internal `chapter-name.html` cross-links are excluded (Jekyll-rendered paths, not real files against raw `.md` source).
- **Found while setting up the link checker:** `add/reference.md` links to `inbox.md` (~20 times) and once to `FM_for_UES.md`, but `inbox.md` doesn't exist in the repo. Logged in `TODO.md`; not fixed yet since it's tied to the still-open `add/` merge decision.

## Before 2026-09-11

- `2a3938b` Published the v1.1 textbook as a Jekyll site (just-the-docs theme): Parts I–VII plus Appendices A–C.
